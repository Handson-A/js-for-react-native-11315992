# Array Manipulation assignment

This project demonstrates basic array manipulation using JavaScript. It consists of four main tasks:

1. Processing an array of numbers.
2. Formatting an array of strings based on processed numbers.
3. Creating a user profile from names and modified names.
4. Creating a readme file

### Task 1: Process Array

In the `arrayManipulation.js` file, a function `processArray` is defined to process an array of numbers. The function squares even numbers and triples odd numbers.

### Task 2: Format Array Strings

In the `arrayManipulation.js` file, another function `formatArrayStrings` is defined. This function takes an array of strings and an array of numbers, modifying each string based on its corresponding number. It converts strings that correspond to odd numbers to uppercase and the even numbers to lower case.

### Task 3: Create User Profiles

In the `userInfo.js` file, the `createUserProfiles` function is defined. It takes an array of names and an array of modified names gotten from task 2's functions, returning an array of user profile objects.

This later outputs an array of user profiles with IDs, original names, and modified names.

### Task 4:

The readme.md file is created
